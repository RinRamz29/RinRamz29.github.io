# About Me

Hi, I’m Rin 

I’m a **game developer** and **AI enthusiast** with a passion for building interactive experiences and intelligent systems. My journey began in the world of **game development**, where I learned how to bring stories, mechanics, and worlds to life through code. Over time, my curiosity led me to the field of **artificial intelligence**, where I now explore how technology can solve real-world problems and empower people.  

I’ve worked on projects ranging from **indie games** and **educational apps** to **fine-tuned AI models for medical research**. Alongside coding, I enjoy diving into maker projects like **3D printing** and experimenting with **blockchain applications**.  

What drives me is a simple idea: **using technology to create meaningful experiences**,whether that means entertaining players, helping students learn, or giving researchers better tools to innovate.  

This site is where I share my work, reflections, and experiments. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate.
