# Hi, I'm Rin 

I've always been passionate about creating things. My professional journey began in the world of **game development**, where I discovered that programming was not just code: it was a way to bring ideas, worlds, and experiences to life.

## My First Steps 

I started my career as a **game developer**, working on small projects that taught me the basics: game engines, physics, combat mechanics, and interactive storytelling. Every line of code was a challenge, but also an opportunity to learn and grow.  

Along the way, I found not just a craft, but also a community: colleagues, friends, and players who enjoyed what we created together.

## The Leap into AI 

Over time, curiosity led me to explore a new horizon: **artificial intelligence**.  
What began as a technical interest—improving gameplay with smarter enemies or more natural dialogues—soon became a true passion.

Today, I focus on researching and developing AI applications that go far beyond gaming: from **language models specialized in medicine** to **systems that support scientific research**.  

## What Drives Me 

What connects both stages of my career is the same idea: **using technology to create meaningful experiences**.  
In video games, it was the thrill of entertaining and telling stories; in AI, it is the possibility of solving real-world problems and improving people's lives.

This blog will be a space to share lessons learned, reflections, and projects—both from the world of **game dev** and **AI dev**.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to this journey with me.
